### Freedom Scientific Focus 40 Blue (5th Gen.)

Braille Commands for Linux assistive-technology stack:

* Orca screen reader program in graphical-mode
* Speakup a kernel-based screen reader for the Linux console in text-mode
* BRLTTY daemon to power the Focus 40 Blue (5th Gen.)

### Orientation of Focus 40 Blue (5th Gen.)

The Focus 40 Blue (5th Gen.) is a 40-cell refreshable braille display, with a perkins-style keyboard, a menu button, nav rockers, nav mode buttons, panning buttons, rocker bars, selector and shift buttons.

#### The Top Face

The top section of the braille display is divided into two sections: front and rear. The rear section of the display has a perkins-style braille keyboard that represents the dots of an 8-dot braille cell. The keys under the left hand represent dots 1, 2, 3, and 7, where dot 1 is located under the index finger and dot 7 under the little finger. The keys under the right hand represent dots 4, 5, 6, and 8, where dot 4 is located under the index finger and dot 8 under the little finger. Between dots 1 and 4 is a Menu button which is used to access the Focus configuration menu as well as display Focus status information during an active connection.

The front section of the braille display consists of 40-cells with a cursor routing key above each cell. There is a space bar in the centre of below the refreshable braille cells. At each end of the display are NAV Rockers used for easy navigation. Positioned above each NAV Rocker is a NAV Mode button which cycles through the different navigation modes.

**NOTE:** Older models of the Focus 40 Blue had a navrow key immediately behind each routing key. On the Focus 40 Blue (5th Gen.) the navrow key can be emulated by a long press of the corresponding routing key.


#### Front Edge

On the front edge of the display are five buttons: eight thumb keys. From left to right, the buttons are as follows:

* Left Panning button
* Left Rocker bar
* Left Selector button
* Left Shift button
* Right Shift button
* Right Selector button
* Right Rocker bar
* Right Panning button

The Braille keyboard, command keys, and thumb keys can be used to perform navigation commands:
