#### The Top Face

The top section of the braille display is divided into two sections: front and rear. The rear section of the display has a perkins-style braille keyboard that represents the dots of an 8-dot braille cell. The keys under the left hand represent dots 1, 2, 3, and 7, where dot 1 is located under the index finger and dot 7 under the little finger. The keys under the right hand represent dots 4, 5, 6, and 8, where dot 4 is located under the index finger and dot 8 under the little finger. Between dots 1 and 4 is a Menu button which is used to access the Focus configuration menu as well as display Focus status information during an active connection.

The front section of the braille display consists of 40-cells with a cursor routing key above each cell. There a space bars in the centre of below the refreshable braille cells. At each end of the display are NAV Rockers used for easy navigation. Positioned above each NAV Rocker is a NAV Mode button which cycles through the different navigation modes.
